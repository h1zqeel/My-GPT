# Contribution Guidelines 

Welcome to MyGPT! We greatly appreciate your interest in contributing to our project. Below are the guidelines to help you understand the process of contributing and ensure a smooth collaboration.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking our project's repository to your GitHub account. This will create a copy of the project in your account, allowing you to make changes without affecting the original repository.

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the forked repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/h1zqeel/My-GPT.git
   ```

3. **Create a Branch**: Create a new branch for your contribution. Choose a descriptive and meaningful name for your branch that reflects the changes you intend to make. Use the following command to create a new branch:
   ```
   git checkout -b your-branch-name
   ```

## Making Contributions

1. **Code Changes**: Write your code changes or improvements with clear and concise comments where necessary. Ensure your code adheres to our project's coding standards and follows the programming language best practices.

2. **Commit Changes**: When you are ready to submit your contribution, commit your changes with a descriptive commit message. A good commit message should briefly explain the changes you made. Use the following command to commit your changes:
   ```
   git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message"
   ```

3. **Pull Request**: Push your changes to your forked repository and submit a pull request to the main repository. Provide a detailed explanation of your changes in the pull request description, including the problem solved and any relevant information.

4. **Review Process**: Your pull request will be reviewed by our team members. We may provide feedback or request changes before merging your contribution.

5. **Merging**: After your pull request passes the review process and any required changes are made, it will be merged into the main repository.
