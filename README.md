##### MyGPT
```bash
yarn dev
```

##### What it does:
- Create a GPT BOT with your own System Message that can use `gpt-3.5-turbo`, `gpt-3.5-turbo-16k`, `gpt-4`, `gpt-4-32k` (will be adding rest of the Models soon)
- To be able to create GPT-4 Chats you need to add a API Key that has Permission to use GPT-4 Models
